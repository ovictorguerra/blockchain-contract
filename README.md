# Simple blockchain voting system with Ethereum Smart Contracts

### Basic Knowledge Required
1. Basic Solidity Programming
2. Basics in HTML and JavaScript
3. Creativity and open mind for disruptive businesses

## Session #01 - BlockChain Concepts

* Distributed Database Architecture
* Lists of records (data) synchronized and stored on multiple networked devices - nodes
* Peer to peer networking
* Functional Democracy - The will of the majority prevails (Philosophical Concept)
* Genesis Block - 1Â° Block
*

## Session #02 - Smart Contracts Concepts 

* Similar to any real world contract + coding

#### Levels
Users - Frist Layer
Smart Contracts - Second Layer
BlockChain 

## Session #03 - DApp's

#### DApp's Benefits

1. Better availability due to node redundancy
2. Direct interaction between users and smart contracts
3. JavaScript API for communication with the blockchain
4. Coding of business rules, storing and querying

## Session #04 - Ethereum Platform and Solidity Language

* Web3.js Ethereum JavaScript API:
###### Library for interacting with a local or remote ethereum node

* Functions:
1. Account recovery
2. Send Transactions 
3. Interact with smart contracts 
4. and more 

## Simple architecture of a blockchain voting system

### The flow 
 
1. User votes generating a transaction
2. The smart contract validates the transaction
3. The vote is registered in the blockchain
4. Finally, it is possible for all users to perform audits when necessary
